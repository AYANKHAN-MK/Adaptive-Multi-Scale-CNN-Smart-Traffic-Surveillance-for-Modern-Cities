Adaptive Multi-Scale CNN for Smart Traffic Surveillance (Landing Page)

This repository contains the single-file, responsive landing page for the Adaptive Multi-Scale CNN for Smart Traffic Surveillance capstone project. This front-end artifact was created using pure HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CSS CDN), and JavaScript to demonstrate the project's concept, objectives, and simulated real-time analytics.

üåü Project Overview

This is a conceptual landing page designed to showcase a deep learning system that automates traffic observation, congestion detection, and anomaly identification. The core system, developed using a Multi-Scale CNN, is intended for real-time application in smart city infrastructure.

The dashboard simulation section provides a dynamic, front-end only demonstration of how key metrics (Vehicle Count, Congestion Level, Camera Status) would update in a live application.

üöÄ Technologies Used

This front-end artifact uses a simple, modern stack, entirely contained within one file:

HTML5: Structure and content.

CSS (Tailwind CSS CDN): For responsive, dark-mode styling and modern aesthetics.

JavaScript (Pure ES6): For basic interactive elements (mobile navigation) and the real-time dashboard simulation logic.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running Locally

Since this project is contained in a single .html file, no complex setup or build process is required.

Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the file.

Open the file: Simply drag and drop the traffic_surveillance_landing_page.html file into any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

The page will load instantly, and the JavaScript-based real-time data simulation will begin automatically.

‚ú® Key Features of the Landing Page

Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on both mobile devices and large desktops.

Dark-Mode Aesthetic: A professional, high-contrast dark theme suitable for a data analytics application.

Real-Time Simulation: The "Real-Time Monitoring Status" card uses JavaScript to continuously update metrics (camera count, vehicle flow, congestion) every 5 seconds, providing a realistic feel of a live dashboard.

Clear Project Segmentation: Details the project's objectives and the system architecture based on the Capstone Synopsis.
